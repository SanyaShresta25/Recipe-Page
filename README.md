### What I Learned

I practiced:

- Writing clean semantic HTML using tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Structuring layouts with just CSS and no frameworks
- Creating responsive pages with max-width containers and fluid spacing
- Styling using color tokens provided in the design spec

#### Sample Code I’m Proud Of:

```html
<section>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2–3 large eggs</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  </ul>
</section>
